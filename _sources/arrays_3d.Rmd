# Three-dimensional arrays

```{python}
# Our usual set-up
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Set 'gray' as the default colormap
plt.rcParams['image.cmap'] = 'gray'

# Display array values to 4 digits of precision
np.set_printoptions(precision=4, suppress=True)
```

So far we have seen one-dimensional and two-dimensional arrays.  These are easy to think about, the one-dimensional array is like a row from a table or spreadsheet.  A two-dimensional array is has rows and columns, like a table or a spreadsheet.

A three-dimensional array takes a little bit more work to visualize, and get used to.

## Two dimensions before three

One way to think of three-dimensional arrays is as stacks of 2D arrays.

Here are a couple of two-dimensional arrays.

```{python}
first_1d = np.arange(10, 22)
first_2d = np.reshape(first_1d, (4, 3))
first_2d
```

```{python}
second_1d = np.arange(100, 112)
second_2d = np.reshape(second_1d, (4, 3))
second_2d
```

We can get rows from the 2D arrays by slicing with an index on the first dimension, thus:

```{python}
# Third row, all the columns.
first_2d[2, :]
```

Or, we can get columns by slicing with an index on the second dimension:

```{python}
# All the rows, second column.
first_2d[:, 1]
```

These 2D arrays have four elements along the first dimension (axis), and three
elements along the second dimension (axis).

```{python}
first_2d.shape
```

They therefore have `4 * 3 = 12` elements each.   The `np.prod` function multiples all the elements in a sequence, so we can get the number of elements in an array with:

```{python}
# 4 * 3
np.prod(first_2d.shape)
```

but there is even a short-cut way to get that:

```{python}
first_2d.size
```

## Three dimensions

Here we make a three-dimension array, by stacking the two 2D arrays together.

First we create an empty array of the right shape:

```{python}
into_3d = np.zeros((4, 3, 2))
into_3d.shape
```

Then we make the first 2D array be the first 4 by 3 slab of the 3D array:

```{python}
# Set all rows, all columns for slab 0:
into_3d[:, :, 0] = first_2d
```

and the second 2D array be the second 4 by 3 slab:

```{python}
# Set all rows, all columns for slab 1:
into_3d[:, :, 1] = second_2d
```

This is how Numpy shows us the contents of the array:

```{python}
into_3d
```

This is looking at the array in a different way, where the slices are in the first dimension, like this:

```{python}
# First row, all columns, all slabs.
into_3d[0, :, :]
```

```{python}
# Second row, all columns, all slabs.
into_3d[1, :, :]
```

Make a prediction of what the values would look like by slicing in the second dimension.
